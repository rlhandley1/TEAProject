                <h4>Environmental Benefits of Owning Electric Vehicles:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Reduced emissions:</strong> Electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, meaning they emit no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This helps to reduce air pollution and mitigate the effects of climate change.</li>
                  <li><strong>Improved energy efficiency:</strong> Electric cars are more energy efficient than ICE cars. They convert around 60% of the electrical energy from the grid to power the wheels, while ICE cars only convert around 20% of the energy stored in gasoline to power the wheels. This means electric cars use less energy to travel the same distance, reducing overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Renewable energy integration:</strong> Electric cars can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are becoming increasingly common and cost-effective. This allows for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to ICE cars, which are fueled by non-renewable fossil fuels.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reduced noise pollution:</strong> Electric cars are much quieter than ICE cars, reducing noise pollution in urban areas and improving overall quality of life.</li>
                  <li><strong>Improved resource management:</strong> Electric cars use fewer natural resources than ICE cars. They require fewer fluids like oil and coolant, and their regenerative braking systems help to extend the life of brake pads and reduce waste.</li>
